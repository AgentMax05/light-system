## Key Features

âœ… **Full compatibility** with all original visualization effects (spectrum, energy, scroll)  
âœ… **Hardware brightness control** using SK9822's built-in brightness (0-31)  
âœ… **Optimized performance** with change detection and SPI speeds up to 4MHz  
âœ… **Easy configuration** via `config.py`  
âœ… **Robust wiring** - SK9822 is more reliable than WS2812B  
âœ… **Maintained compatibility** with original library structure  

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Hardware Setup
```
SK9822 Strip:
  VCC â†’ 5V Power Supply (NOT Pi)
  GND â†’ Pi GND + Power Supply GND (common ground)
  DI  â†’ Pi GPIO 10 (MOSI, Pin 19)
  CI  â†’ Pi GPIO 11 (SCLK, Pin 23)
  
Audio:
  USB Microphone â†’ Any USB port
```

### 2. Software Setup
```bash
# Enable SPI
sudo raspi-config  # Interface Options â†’ SPI â†’ Enable

# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-numpy python3-scipy portaudio19-dev
pip3 install numpy scipy pyaudio spidev

# Configure
cd audio-reactive-led-strip/python
nano config.py  # Verify DEVICE = 'pi-sk9822' and N_PIXELS = 300
```

### 3. Run
```bash
cd audio-reactive-led-strip
python3 run_sk9822.py
```

## Configuration Options

```python
# In python/config.py
DEVICE = 'pi-sk9822'          # Enable SK9822 mode
N_PIXELS = 300                # Your LED count
SPI_SPEED_HZ = 1000000        # SPI speed (1-4 MHz)
SK9822_BRIGHTNESS = 31        # Global brightness (0-31)
USE_GUI = False               # Disable for performance
FPS = 60                      # Target frame rate
MIN_FREQUENCY = 200           # Low frequency cutoff
MAX_FREQUENCY = 12000         # High frequency cutoff
N_FFT_BINS = 24              # Frequency bins
```

## How It Works

1. **Audio Capture** (`microphone.py`)
   - Captures audio from USB device at `MIC_RATE` (44.1kHz)
   
2. **Audio Processing** (`dsp.py`, `visualization.py`)
   - FFT transforms audio to frequency domain
   - Mel filterbank separates into frequency bins
   - Visualization effects map frequencies to RGB values
   
3. **LED Output** (`led.py` â†’ `led_sk9822.py`)
   - Receives RGB array (3, N_PIXELS)
   - Applies gamma correction
   - Formats data for SK9822 (start frame, LED data, end frame)
   - Sends via SPI at configured speed

## Advantages of SK9822 over WS2812B

| Feature | SK9822 | WS2812B |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Protocol | SPI (robust) | PWM timing (sensitive) |
| Speed | Up to 4MHz | Limited by timing |
| Brightness | Hardware + PWM | PWM only |
| Wiring | Clock + Data | Data only |
| Reliability | Higher | Lower |
| Pi Compatibility | Direct 3.3V | May need level shifter |

## Visualization Effects

### 1. Spectrum (default)
Displays frequency spectrum as colored bars expanding from center.

### 2. Energy
Expands from center based on overall sound energy in frequency bands.

### 3. Scroll
Colors scroll outward from center, creating a flowing effect.

**To change:** Edit `python/visualization.py` and modify:
```python
visualization_effect = visualize_spectrum  # or visualize_energy, visualize_scroll
```

## Testing

### LED Test Only
```bash
cd python
python3 led_sk9822.py
```
This runs a crawling LED and rainbow cycle test.

### Full Visualization
```bash
python3 run_sk9822.py
```
Play music and watch the LEDs react!

## Troubleshooting

**LEDs don't light up?**
- Check SPI enabled: `lsmod | grep spi`
- Verify wiring (MOSI=GPIO10, SCLK=GPIO11)
- Check power supply is adequate
- Ensure common ground

**No audio detected?**
- List devices: `arecord -l`
- Check PyAudio can see it
- Try different `MIC_RATE` values

**Low FPS?**
- Disable GUI: `USE_GUI = False`
- Increase SPI speed: `SPI_SPEED_HZ = 2000000`
- Lower FPS target: `FPS = 40`
- Reduce LED count for testing

## Performance Tips

For best performance on Raspberry Pi 5 with 300 LEDs:
- Use `SPI_SPEED_HZ = 2000000` (2 MHz)
- Set `SK9822_BRIGHTNESS = 15` (saves power, still bright)
- Disable GUI and FPS display
- Close other applications
- Consider overclocking Pi if needed

## What's NOT Changed

âœ… All visualization algorithms  
âœ… Audio processing pipeline  
âœ… FFT and frequency analysis  
âœ… Color mapping and effects  
âœ… Configuration structure  

Only the LED output method was changed from WS2812B/PWM to SK9822/SPI.

## Next Steps

1. Test LED strip with `python3 python/led_sk9822.py`
2. Verify audio input works
3. Run full visualizer with `python3 run_sk9822.py`
4. Tune settings in `config.py` for your setup
5. Choose your favorite visualization effect
6. Optional: Set up auto-start on boot (see SK9822_SETUP.md)
